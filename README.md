# Lettuce Know

## What is this project?

This is a project that I worked on with a remote team of developers at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes). It was a mentorship program that allowed us to really learn how to collaborate and communicate effectively while we worked on different parts of the project asynchronously in pairs. I gained experience pair-programming, creating Pull Requests, writing code reviews, and merging multiple branches to main each week. Each week was a sprint where we were assigned various issues to work on, and every other week, we completed a retrospective as a team where we shared 1) Appreciations, 2) What went well, and 3) What could be improved upon.

The project itself is a "smart" shopping list app. You create a new shopping list, and for each item you add to the list, you'll select how soon you're likely to buy it (soon, kinda soon, not soon). The more frequently you buy an item, it'll move up the list according to how likely you're likely to buy it again.
